RE: TV,"So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You 
write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  

You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made 
to me on October 18th, 2001).
Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I 
cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any 
exceptions for you.

Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.

Enron Japan Trading,"Hi,  How is everyone doing?  Busy , Busy, Busy I know.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and 
several questions have come up.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.  

  Please advise.

Thank you,

that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that

In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today.

from NSP and sold $52 to AMRN). Three MAPP Fs were submitted showing as the 
POD:  (NSP.AMRN, ALTW.AMRN, MEC.AMRN).    All the requests were returned as 
""refused.""  Ample ATCs were showing on the MAPP web page from NSP to AMRN, 
ALTW to AMRN, MEC to AMRN.  Pat, the file with these ATC printouts are on 
your desk.  No explanation was given as to the reason for the refusal on the 
oasis.  Furthermore, no explanation was given upon calling the MAPP Security 
Center.  In fact, the gentleman at MAPP hung up on us when we called.

MISO Approved for Start Up of Transmission Functions,"Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Re: Facility Fees,"Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month

Staff Meetings,"Same time, same place -- just not as often!

I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 
2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM 
meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and 
EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team 
meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM 
management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you 
and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global 
Markets.  

I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the 
calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line 
reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the 
professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time

A note on PMA's,"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a 
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected, 
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a ""red flagged"" reminder notice should be

Re: Got caught up with real time issue - missed my slot today,"I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not 
even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is 
to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to 
busts.  

I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.

Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great 
to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different 
commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the 
interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your 
efforts.  --Sally

Emily's First Pictures,"Just so you can see where my paycheck now goes.  What a great way to spend 
money!
djs


Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 
days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day 
she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I 
didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person 
(better) because of her.  
Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she 
was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We 
are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it 
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down 
to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I 
hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by 
the way, the blonde at the hospital with me is my youngest sister, Kerri)

VP PRC,"The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice 
Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is 
set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice 
Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming 
that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule 
your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your 
review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process 
along with Peggy and Brent.)

On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for 
Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this 
event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the 
location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your 
calendars:  November 15-17.

(No Subject),"Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it,

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie

We took as an action from the last meeting the need to re-authorise all 
traders within the metals global businesses, sign this list off with the 
EnronMetals Managing Directors and accompany this list with a note 
highlighting the dangers of non authorised trading activity.

Due to the storm here yesterday we had to delay the operational control

(No Subject),"To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?

End of Season,"Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

Internet E-mail,"
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses.

2001 Plan vs 2000 Forecast Explanation,"Sarah,
Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL) 
increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a 
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new 
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of 
supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.

Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

can talk by phone on Monday night to review bonuses for your group or we can 
plan on meeting first thing on Tuesday, the 11th.  I do not yet know at what 
time on Tuesday we will have to have final changes made.  --Sally

Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the 
hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.  
Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at 
the ASE.

Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since 
arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own 
devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday 
night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are 
planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back 
to the hotel.

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:
